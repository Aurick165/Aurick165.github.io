## About Me

As a dedicated and highly driven undergraduate student, I am deeply passionate about chip design and Deep Learning applications. My expertise includes working with Sentaurus Synopsys TCAD,  Cadence Simulation toolbox and various Machine Learning frameworks. With a year of experience as a TCAD engineer at a prominent company in our country, I have honed my skills in this field. I have also earned an international Deep Learning competition award and participated in regional Deep Learning and analog design competitions. With an optimistic outlook, I aspire to achieve something that benefits both my country and humanity.
